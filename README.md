# Vets Who Code Application

## Description
Thanks for coming to my Vets Who Code Application. This is my first project, and it's designed to do three things:
1. Introduce myself to Vets Who Code.
2. Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create something that reflects my personality and aspirations.
3. Provide a learning opportunity for me to get introduced to the world of coding.

Honestly, I'm not sure if Vets Who Code will be the only ones who look at this, but if there are other people who come and visit, welcome to my first project!

## Features
- **Personalized Greeting**: Enter your name and receive a personalized greeting.
